 <li> 1/4 teaspoon salt plus more for the chicken</li>
 <li> 1/4 teaspoon pepper plus more for the chicken</li>
 <li> 1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour</li>
 <li>2 large eggs </li>
 <li> 2 tablespoons milk any percentage</li>
 <li> 4 tablespoons olive oil divided</li>
        </ul>  </p>
 
 <h4> Sauce Ingredients</h4>
 <p> <ul>
 <li> 1/4 cup (55g) butter salted or unsalted is fine</li>
 <li> 2 large garlic cloves pressed or diced</li>
 <li>3/4 cup chicken broth </li>
 <li> 3/4 cup dry white wine </li>
 <li> 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice </li>
 <li> 2 tablespoons minced parsley </li>
         </ul></p>
 
         <h4> Steps</h4>
 <p> <ol>
 <li> Preheat oven to 200°F and line a baking sheet with 
     parchment paper or foil for easy cleanup. 
     Place a pot of lightly salted water on to boil for the pasta. </li>
     <li>Cut chicken breasts in half horizontally by placing one hand on top 
         of each chicken breast and slicing the top and bottom into two thin, 
         even pieces. </li>
         <li> Two at a time, cover chicken breast halves in plastic wrap or place them in a 
             large plastic bag and use the flat side of a meat mallet or a rolling pin 
             to pound each chicken piece to 1/4-inch thick*. 
             Sprinkle both sides lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
             <li>In pie tin or shallow dish large enough to fit a chicken breast, whisk together flour, salt, and pepper.
                  In a second shallow dish, whisk together eggs and milk. </li>
                  <li> Dip first chicken piece in flour until completely covered. Then dip in egg 
                      mixture and then back into the flour mixture. Gently shake the chicken breast
                      so that any extra flour falls off, and transfer the chicken to a plate. 
                      Repeat with remaining three pieces.</li>
                      <Li> n a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over
                           medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add 2* of the chicken 
                           breasts and cook for 1 to 3 minutes per side, until golden 
                           and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of
                            the breasts reads 165°F.</Li>
                            <li> Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet and place
                                 in the warm oven. Wipe out pan with a paper towel 
                                 and repeat with remaining oil and the rest of the 
                                 chicken.</li>
                                 <li> Add pasta to boiling water and cook according to 
                                     pasta instructions. Drain and set aside. </li>
                                     <li> While your pasta cooks, once again wipe out your 
                                         skillet with paper towels and place it on medium heat. 
                                         Add butter and once butter is melted, add garlic and cook 
                                         until garlic is lightly golden and fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
</ol></p>

<h4> Sauce</h4>
<p> <ol>
<li> Add broth, wine, and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer and cook for 8 to 10
     minutes, until sauce is reduced by a little over 1/2, down to about 3/4 cup. </li>
<li> Add salt and pepper to taste and stir in optional parsley.</li>
<li>Plate pasta and chicken and spoon sauce over the top. Serve and enjoy! </li>
